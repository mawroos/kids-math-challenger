### Example Prompts by School Year

**Year 3 (Age 8-9):**
```
Write a short poem about your favorite animal. 
Describe what it looks like, how it moves, and why you like it. 
Try to use words that help us imagine the animal clearly!
```

**Year 7 (Age 12-13):**

capture both the 'before' and 'after' of your chosen moment.
```

**Year 11 (Age 16-17):**

Compose a poem exploring the concept of identity. Consider how we define 
ourselves, what shapes us, and whether we are constant or ever-changing. 
Use literary devices like metaphor or symbolism to convey your ideas.
```

## Step 4: Write Your Poem

### Example Submission (Year 5 Student)

**Prompt:** "Write a poem about a magical place you'd like to visit."

**Student's Poem:**
```
Beyond the rainbow's colorful arc,
There lies a land both bright and dark,
Where crystal rivers softly flow,
And purple mountains touch the snow.

The trees are tall with silver leaves,
That whisper secrets to the breeze,
And flowers bloom in shades unknown,
With petals soft as clouds are shown.

I'd walk through forests made of light,
Where stars shine bright both day and night,
And meet the creatures kind and wise,
With twinkling, understanding eyes.

This place exists inside my mind,
A magical world I hope to find,
Where dreams come true and hearts can soar,
A wondrous land forevermore.
```

## Step 5: Receive Assessment

The AI analyzes the poem and provides comprehensive feedback:
